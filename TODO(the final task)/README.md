## About
- The idea used to design this app was mapping the list of elements with a particular date and displaying them when that date was clicked...
- The flutter calendar package is used for displaying and accessing the the calendar..
- Today's date stays highlighted throughout the app..
- The **_events** is a map that maps Date and its respected events that are added in it...
- Everytime the user clicks a date in the calendar(which is present on the screen all the time) user can add the events to that respected date and the events for the date is displayed when the date is clicked..
- The State Management method **setState** was used as the app depended on only one state to be changed (i.e only the map had to be updated on any event that took place.. bloc was too complicated to be implemented for it to be used in this idea of the app)..
-The code has comments which makes easier for the reader to understand it..
- The app notifies once at 8am everyday so that user is reminded to add ot to do any task...the user also is notifies when there is a task added everytime..
